```

### Risk Assessment Formula
```
Combined Risk Score = (Flood Probability × 0.7) + (Population Proximity × 0.3)

Risk Classification:
  • 🟢 Low:              Score < 0.25
  • 🟡 Medium:           0.25 ≤ Score < 0.50
  • 🟠 High:             0.50 ≤ Score < 0.75
  • 🔴 Immediate Action: Score ≥ 0.75
```

### Color Scale Mapping
```
Plotly Colorscale:
  0.0 → #003a00 (Dark Green)     [No Risk]
  0.3 → #00ff88 (Neon Green)     [Low Risk]
  0.5 → #ffff00 (Yellow)         [Caution]
  0.7 → #ff6600 (Orange)         [Warning]
  1.0 → #ff0080 (Hot Pink)       [Critical]
```

## Known Limitations

1. **File Size Limit**: 2GB maximum
   - *Solution*: Split large scenes or use compression

2. **Single Scene Processing**: One scene at a time
   - *Solution*: Use batch mode for multiple files sequentially

3. **No Real-Time Streaming**: Not supported
   - *Planned*: COPERNICUS API integration

4. **No Time-Series Analysis**: Single snapshot only
   - *Planned*: Multi-temporal change detection

5. **No Custom Model Training**: In dashboard
   - *Solution*: Use RDF-2-training.py for retraining

---

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features (v1.1+)
- [ ] Real-time COPERNICUS API streaming
- [ ] Multi-temporal change detection
- [ ] PDF report generation
- [ ] Shapefile export for GIS
